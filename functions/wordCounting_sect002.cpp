/// @brief Code snippets and comments used to discuss and write functions.

// First:
// Given a character, write a predicate function that returns whether the 
//  provided character is a vowel (y counts as a vowel)

// Second: 
// Given a word, write a function that will count & return the number of 
//  vowels that are contained within the provided word

// Third: 
// Given a word, write a function that will count & return the number of 
//  consonants that are contained within the provided word

// Fourth: 
// Write a function called testCons that tests the consonant counting 
//  function with several different possible word scenarios

// Lastly: 
// Write a main function that iterates over an input file of words and outputs
//  each word and its number of vowels and consonants, such as:
//      The word yellow contains 2 vowels and 3 consonants.
//  Lastly, the main function should keep track of the total vowels, total
//  consonants, and total words within the input file. Once all input words are 
//  processed the main program should output the totals, such as:
//      Across 31 words there are 50 vowels and 79 consonants.
