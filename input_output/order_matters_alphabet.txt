Question:
In your notebook, write the alphabet.

Five potential answers:
// all upper case letters in the alphabet in order
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

// all lower case letters in the alphabet in order
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

// a mix of upper and lower case letters
// of the alphabet in order
abCdEfghijKLMnopqrstuvwxyz

// all the letters in the alphabet but not in order
abvwpqcdefghixylmnorjkstuz

// the most literal interpretation of the question
the alphabet


// Order is important. The following have the
// same three elements but produce different results.
cout << "World" << "Hello";
cout << "Hello" << "World";

Order is built into our linguistics. Order is important,
and we don't always explicitly denote that fact. When
we think about the alphabet or ask someone to say the 
alphabet, it is almost always implied the the alphabet
is the inorder sequence of letters from a to z. If
we wrote something else, then that may contain all 
the letters of the alphabet but that is not what is 
most commonly expected. This implicit expectation is 
something that becomes tricky when dealing with other
individuals who utilize another alphabet, or in our case
a computer. Each expectation needs to be explicitly
stated, the computer is not built to read human 
contextual clues nor is it a mind reader.
