Question:
Given 3 people standing next to you. 
What are the steps you would take to determine the tallest person?
What if you were blind and could only talk to them? 
     How would you adapt your steps?
DO NOT write code, just the steps you wish to take to solve your problem

Potential Answer:
check if A is taller than B
     if he taller than B, check if A is taller than C
         if he is taller than C, then he is the tallest
check if B is taller than A
     if he taller than A, check if B is taller than C
         if he is taller than C, then he is the tallest
check if C is taller than A
     if he taller than A, check if C is taller than B
         if he is taller than B, then he is the tallest

Potential Answer:
check if A is taller than B
     if he taller than B, check if A is taller than C
         if he is taller than C, then he is the tallest
         if he is not taller than C, then C is the tallest
based on initial check, B is taller than A
     check if B is taller than C
         if he is taller than C, then he is the tallest
         if he is not taller than C, then C is the tallest
