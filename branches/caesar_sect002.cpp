// In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is also known as 
//  the shift cipher. This cipher is one of the simplest and most 
//  widely known encryption techniques. 
// Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which 
//  each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter 
//  some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
// For example, with a left shift of -3, 
//  D would be replaced by A, 
//  E would become B, and so on. 
// To decrypt, you simply shift backwards the same shift amount.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Assume lowercase letters and word size of 3.
    // Implement caesar cipher printing out the encrypted word and
    // then do decryption case printing out decrypted word at end 
    // If your algorithm is correct, the user's word should be output at the end

    return 0;
